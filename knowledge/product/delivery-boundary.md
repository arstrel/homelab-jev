# Implemented foundation and planned release

Section 1 is complete: pinned Node/TypeScript tooling, configuration validation, bounded provider checks, structured logging, Drizzle/pg ledger schema and repositories, migrations, deterministic Git gates, PostgreSQL regression tests and required CI. The CLI can report ledger status and perform explicit connection/database commands. Google authorization tooling supports repeat grants.

Sections 2–8 remain planned: Gmail synchronization, typed classification and evaluation, Todoist reconciliation, Retro interpretation, Drive handoff, launchd deployment and rollout evidence. `status` counts ledger rows; it does not currently prove provider freshness. `cycle` is not a working scheduler or processing loop.

The initial release includes obligation capture and routing. Inferred resolution remains a review suggestion. Gmail label writes, automatic completion from model inference, Calendar writes and whole-inbox cleanup require later changes.

Follow [development gates](/operations/development-gates.md) and [release operations](/operations/native-releases.md). Consult the current OpenSpec checklist before changing this summary.
